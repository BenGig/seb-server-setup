What is Safe Exam Browser (SEB)?
--------------------------------

`Safe Exam Browser <https://safeexambrowser.org/>`_ (SEB) is an application to carry out e-assessments safely. 
The freeware application is available for Windows, macOS and iOS. It turns any computer temporarily into a secure workstation. 
It controls access to resources like system functions, other websites and applications and prevents unauthorized resources being 
used during an exam. Safe Exam Browser can work with Open edX to control what a student can access during a Open edX quiz attempt. 
With the SEB Open edX plugin you activate the SEB support in Open edX and now only students using an approved version of SEB and the 
correct settings will be able to access the quiz in your Open edX course. The Safe Exam Browser is offered under a Mozilla Public License 
and supported by the `SEB Consortium <https://safeexambrowser.org/consortium/>`_.


What is Safe Exam Browser Server (SEB Server)?
----------------------------------------------

While the interaction with SEB is well known in Learning Management Systems (LMS) like `Open edX <https://open.edx.org/>`_, 
`Moodle <https://moodle.org/>`_ etc. the SEB Server is an entirely new component to set up secured online exams. 
It interacts with the assessments system/LMS as well as with SEB on exam clients.It supports exam scenarios on student owned devices (BYOD) 
and on managed devices.

SEB Server is a modern webservice with a REST API and a GUI service on top of it. SEB Server is written in Java and uses Docker for installation and setup.

SEB Server provides a range of basic functionalities:

- Built-in institutional multitenancy 
- Linking of multiple Learning Management Systems (LMS). Currently supported: `Open edX <https://open.edx.org/>`_
- Accessing the Course/Exam-API of a linked LMS to import a courses or exams for managing with SEB Server
- Creation and administration of SEB Client Configurations that can be used to startup a SEB and that contains SEB Server connection information for a SEB Client
- Creation and administration of SEB Exam Configurations that can be bound to an imported Exam to automatically configure a SEB Client that connects to an exam that is managed by SEB Server
- Automated SEB restriction on LMS side if the specified type of LMS supports the SEB restriction API
- Monitoring and administration of SEB Client connections within a running exam

The image below shows a very simplified diagram that locates the SEB Server in a setup with a Learning Management System (LMS) and the 
Safe Exam Browser (SEB). The SEB Server communicates with the LMS for managing and prepare exams as well as with the SEB Client to ensure 
a more automated and secure setup for high-stake exams.

What is the SEB Server Setup repository?
----------------------------------------

The SEB Server Setup repository contains predefined, docker-based installation directories for different installation proposes like demo, 
testing or production. The repository is completely separated from the SEB Server source repository and contains only files for 
setup-configuration and installation of a SEB Server infrastructure. The idea is that this repository can be cloned from a Server/VM on 
that the SEB Server has to be installed. One can then navigate to the directory with the needed setup and adapt the configuration files if needed. 
Then just use Docker to build up the SEB Server.
